*WARNING* python script will not work if not used with same setup as our modified DB
This modified db contains new tables holding data for joining certain ways and new columns such as age and age range developed based off time stamps.
Python file uses queries.txt file which holds the stored procedures names to run.
This section is to specifically hold the SQL files that contain the original queries and for the python script.
The python script is simply designed to run the queries that were all saved as stored procedures and pull their results into CSVS.
Connector information was based on local testing and will need to be changed to work.
